### Purpose
We want to help the parents of our friend Steve, they want to invest in the stock market and for this we have prepared a VBA macro so that they can visualize the performance of different corporations during the years of 2018 and 2019. The Macro must execute in a short period of time and must dynamically display the necessary data to make a good investment. For this we need to refactor the original script so it can go through numerous sheets of stock in a quicker way.
### Background
Currently the green energy market is growing, there are different sustainable energies among which are solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal. Among the most successful stocks in the market are Daqo New Energy Corp. (DQ), Renewable Energy Group Inc. (REGI) and SunPower Corp. (SPWR) 1. It is the Daqo stock that Steve's family is most interested in. Daqo New Energy is a China company who has achieved remarkable accommodation in the field of new energy development and utilization and formed complete industry chain covering polycrystalline, ingot and wafer, solar cell and panel, PV inverter, and solar power plant2. To make a good investment, Steveâ€™s family need to know what their return can be, in its simplest terms, is the money made or lost on an investment over some period of time3.
## Results
---
By refactoring the VBA macro we optimize the analysis process of the sustainable energy stock market database As can be seen in Figure 1, the process is 10 times faster than what Tom had been told in a first review. This was achieved by performing a ticker index. The database is made up of the stock of 12 companies and their performance during 2017 and 2018.
In the 2017 stock market of renewable energy companies, we observed that 11 of them had a positive return, highlighting that DQ had a return of 199.4% and SEDG of 184.5%. TERP was the only stock that had a negative return.
In 2018, the behavior of the stock market in the field of renewable energies was of a generally negative return, where only ENPH and RUN stock obtained a positive return of around 80%, a year before their values were 129 and 5.5% . so the only stock that had real growth was RUN (Figure 2).

## Summary
---
The refactored scripts were faster than those written throughout module 2, this was thanks to us giving an instruction to do a tickerIndex to access the correct index across the four different arrays.
